## Crystal Report


</div>

### Description

I had to create a report using Crystal Reports 8. I struggled to find anything on the net so I came up with this. I hope you guys find it useful.

This code does several things wrt Crystal Reports.

1. It allows you to display a crystal report

2. To email a crystal report in .pdf format

3. Print the report

4. Update the database location on crystal reports at run time. (The database in crystal must be an ADO connection)

Please vote for this and give me any comments.
 
### More Info
 
You will need Crystal Reports Version 8 RDC to run this program
